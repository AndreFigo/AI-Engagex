- Run main_keras.py using:
  - `python3 main_keras.py model_name`

- Run visualization tool after training using:
  - `python3 visualization.py model_name player_number`
  
*model_name* is the name chosen for the model to be trained and later visualized.
*player_number* starts at 0 and can be up to 3 (configurable).
